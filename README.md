A nice challenge for week 1!

This project was a nice intro to transferring math knowledge into a development challenge. 
Using a basic template expedited the process of setting up the project which allowed me more time to focus on creating the solution.

Thank you for taking the time to read this document, please feel free to share your thoughts.
